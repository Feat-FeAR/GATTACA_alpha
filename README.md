# GATTACA_alpha

###### Interactive DEA... in times before bioTEA

***GATTACA***--aka General Algorithm for The Transcriptional Analysis by
one-Channel Arrays--is an R pipeline for the analysis of one-color (HD)
microarray gene-expression data.

Being the main precursor to bioTEA, ***GATTACA*** is now a discontinued and
legacy software, still used (and sometimes modified) just for academic purposes
(i.e., testing some new features and reconsidering old functions).

***GATTACA*** exist(ed) in two flavors:
* ***GATTACA_alpha***: the earlier core of our DEA pipeline, written to be run
  interactively within RStudio.
* ***GATTACA_beta***: a *Dockerized* and improved version of the *alpha*,
  designed to be run headless and ensure reproducibility. This is the most
  direct parent to bioTEA.
